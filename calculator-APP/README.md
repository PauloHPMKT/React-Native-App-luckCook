# react-native-imc-calculator-App

This is my first react-native layout app of an IMC calculator

React-native with styles attributes

how use it?
Introduce your weight in kg (Ex: 90)
introduce your height in cm (Ex: 165)

press button calc to get the result

I used expo.io to load the project. To see it working use the following commands:
<b>expo start</b>

if you are not using Android Studio to simulate, open it on browser
<b>Choose option "w" to open you web browser</b>

App interface
<img height="180em" src="./img/screenshort_app.png"/>
